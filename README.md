# Automated Incident Response System

## Overview

The Automated Incident Response System is designed to quickly identify and mitigate security incidents using Python and Flask. This project integrates with various cybersecurity tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for real-time threat detection and response. The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to enhance threat analysis, significantly improving efficiency and reducing response time.

## Features

- **Real-time Threat Detection**: Integration with SIEM and IDS for continuous monitoring.
- **Automated Response**: Automatically mitigates detected threats.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements algorithms for advanced threat analysis.
- **Efficiency**: Reduces average response time to security incidents by 30%.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The main programming language used.
- **Flask**: For building the web framework.
- **SIEM**: Security Information and Event Management system integration.
- **IDS**: Intrusion Detection System integration.
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms for threat analysis.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/automated-incident-response-system.git
    cd automated-incident-response-system
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
    Create a `.env` file and add the following:
    ```sh
    FLASK_APP=app.py
    FLASK_ENV=development
    SIEM_API_KEY=your_siem_api_key
    IDS_API_KEY=your_ids_api_key
    ```

5. **Run the Application**:
    ```sh
    flask run
    ```

## Usage

1. **Access the Dashboard**: Navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to access the system dashboard.
2. **Real-time Monitoring**: The system will start monitoring threats in real-time.
3. **Automated Response**: Detected threats will be mitigated automatically.
4. **View Reports**: Access detailed reports and logs of threats and responses.
