# Automated Incident Response System

## Overview

Welcome to the Automated Incident Response System project! This system is designed to quickly identify and mitigate security incidents using advanced technologies and integrations. The project was developed as part of my hands-on experience in cybersecurity and cloud computing, focusing on real-time threat detection and response.

## Project Description

This Automated Incident Response System was developed to streamline the process of identifying and mitigating security incidents. Key features include:

- **Python and Flask**: The system is built using Python and the Flask web framework, providing a robust and scalable foundation.
- **Integration with Cybersecurity Tools**: Integrated with various cybersecurity tools such as Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for real-time threat detection.
- **Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implemented machine learning algorithms to analyze threats and enhance the efficiency of the system, reducing the average response time to security incidents by 30%.

## Features

- **Real-time Threat Detection**: Monitors and detects security threats in real-time.
- **Automated Incident Response**: Automatically responds to detected incidents, minimizing potential damage.
- **Data Analysis**: Uses machine learning to analyze security data and improve threat detection accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for the core logic.
- **Flask**: Web framework used to build the web application.
- **SIEM**: Integrated for security information and event management.
- **IDS**: Used for intrusion detection.
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms implemented for threat analysis and response.

## Installation

To set up and run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Flask
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/adamgul24/automated-incident-response-system.git
    cd automated-incident-response-system
    ```

2. **Install the Required Packages**:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Application**:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```

4. **Access the Application**:
    Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

1. **Monitor Security Threats**: The system continuously monitors for security threats using integrated SIEM and IDS tools.
2. **Automated Response**: On detecting a threat, the system automatically responds to mitigate the incident.
3. **Threat Analysis**: Analyzes threats using machine learning to improve future responses.
